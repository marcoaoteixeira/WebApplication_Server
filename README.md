# Nameless Web Application

This repository contains all code that I assume is useful in most
of the cases where I need to build something. So, if you think
that it could be useful for you, feel free to fork, clone, etc.
Also, I tried to mention every person that I might get something
from. If you find code that needs to be given the correct authorship,
please, let me know.

## Workflow Status

![main](https://github.com/marcoaoteixeira/WebApplication_Server/blob/main/.github/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)

## Starting

Instructions below will show your the way to get things working.
<br><br>

## Pre-requirements

If working with Docker and local SQL Server instance, enable SQL Server to listen TCP/IP.
See: [Configure a Server to Listen on a Specific TCP Port](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/configure-a-server-to-listen-on-a-specific-tcp-port?view=sql-server-ver16)
<br><br>

## EntityFramework Core

### EF Tools
```powershell
dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef
```

There're two *powershell* scripts in the root folder that are used to update and migrate the database.

```powershell
# Updates the database.
db_update.ps1
```

```powershell
# Creates a new migration when entity objects changes.
# Script will ask for a new migration name before execution.
db_migration.ps1
```

There are some test projects inside the "test" folder. Maybe you'll need to
install the coverage tool and a report tool

```

*.NET Report Generator Tool*
```powershell
dotnet tool install -g dotnet-reportgenerator-globaltool
```
